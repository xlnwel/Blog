## Introduction

We discuss P3O, an policy gradient method that utilizes both on-policy and off-policy data.

## Effective Sample Size

Given a dataset $$X=\{x_1,x_2,\dots,x_N\}$$, and two densities $$p(x)$$ and $$q(x)$$ with $$p(x)$$ being absolutely continuous with respect to $$q(x)$$, the effective sample size is defined as the number of samples from $$p(x)$$ that would provide an estimator with a performance equal to that of the importance sampling estimator $$w(x)=p(x)/q(x)$$ with $$N$$ samples. Because we apply importance sampling when computing policy gradient from off-policy data, we use the following normalized [Kish's effective sample size](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_sample_size#Weighted_samples)

$$
ESS={1\over N}{\Vert w(X)\Vert_1^2\over \Vert w(X)\Vert_2^2}={1\over N}{\left(\sum_xw(x)\right)^2\over(\sum_xw(x)^2)}
$$

Where $$1\over N$$ normalize the effective sample size so that $$ESS\in[0, 1]$$.

In P3O, ESS is used as an indicator of the efficacy of updates to $$\pi$$ with samples drawn from the behavior policy $$\mu$$. If the ESS is large, $$\pi$$ is similar to $$\mu$$, and we can confidently use data from $$\mu$$ to update $$\pi$$.

## P3O

P3O augments the traditional policy gradient objective with off-policy objectives, which results in

$$
\mathcal J(\pi)=\mathbb E_{_\pi}[A(s,a)+\alpha\mathcal H(\pi)]+\mathbb E_{\mu}[\min(\rho,c)A(s,a)]-\mathbb E_\mu[\lambda D_{KL}(\mu\Vert \pi)]
$$

where $$\rho={\pi\over\mu}$$ is the importance ratio, $$c$$ is the truncation threshold we'll discuss later. The corresponding gradient is

$$
\mathbb E_{\pi}[A(s,a)\nabla\log\pi+\alpha\nabla \mathcal H(\pi)]+\mathbb E_{\mu}[\min(\rho,c)A(s,a)\nabla\log\pi-\lambda\nabla D_{KL}(\mu\Vert\pi)]
$$

### Adaptive KL Coefficient and Truncation Threshold

The novelty of P3O lies in the choice of threshold $$c$$ and KL regularization coefficient $$\lambda$$. 

**Adaptive $$\lambda$$.** When $$\pi$$ is far from $$\mu$$, we would like $$\lambda$$ be large so as to push them closer. If they are too similar to each other, it entails that we could be more aggressive with a smaller $$\lambda$$. We use the normalized effective sample size to measure the distance between $$\pi$$ and $$\mu$$, as a result of which we set

$$
\lambda=1-ESS
$$

Figure 2 shows the effect of $$\lambda$$ on performance. Note that $$\lambda$$ also influences the entropy of $$\pi$$ -- A large $$\lambda$$ leads to $$\pi$$ with higher entropy as it pushes $$\pi$$ to be close to previous policies.

**Adaptive $$c$$.** The truncation threshold $$c$$ controls the bias-variance trade-off. The larger $$c$$ is the less bias and the higher variance the policy gradient is of. A small $$c$$ effectively reduces the variance introduced by the importance ratio but incurs some bias. We would like $$c$$ be small when the importance ratio has high variance -- i.e., $$\pi$$ is far from $$\mu$$. Therefore, it is intuitive to set

$$
c=ESS
$$


### Discussion on The KL Penalty

We first show that the KL penalty in P3O slows down optimization. For an optimization problem $$x^*=\arg\min-\alpha\nabla f(x)$$, the gradient update $$x_{k+1}=x_{k}-\alpha\nabla f(x_k)$$ can be written as

$$
x_{k+1}=\arg\min_y\left<\nabla f(x),y\right>+{1\over\alpha}\Vert y-x_k\Vert^2
$$

One can prove it by setting the gradient to zero. A penalty with respect to all previous iterates $$\{x_1,x_2\dots,x_k\}$$ can be written as

$$
x_{k+1}=\arg\min_y\left<\nabla f(x),y\right>+{1\over\alpha}\sum_{i=1}^k\Vert y-x_k\Vert^2
$$

 Setting the gradient to zero, we obtain the update equation

$$
x_{k+1}={1\over k}\sum_{i=1}^kx_i-{\alpha\over k}\nabla f(x_k)
$$

Which has a vanishing step-size as $$k\rightarrow\infty$$. We would expect such a vanishing step-size of the policy gradient to hurt performance.

On the other hand, as the behavior policy $$\mu$$ is a mixture of previous policies, which is highly entropic, penalizing $$\pi$$ against $$\mu$$ encourages $$\pi$$ to explore. 

### Algorithm


$$
\begin{align}
&\text{Rollout }K\text{ trajectories }\tau\text{ for }T\text{ time-steps each}\\\
&\text{Compute return and advantages using GAE}\\\
&\mathcal D\leftarrow \mathcal D\cup\tau\\\
&\text{Perform on-policy update with }\tau\\\
&\xi\leftarrow \text{Poisson}(m)\\\
&\textbf{for } i\le \xi\textbf{ do}\\\
&\quad\text{Perform off-policy update with }\{\tau_1,\dots,\tau_n\}\sim\mathcal D\\\
\end{align}
$$


For Atari games, $$K=16$$, $$T=16$$, $$m=2$$, and $$n=6$$.
