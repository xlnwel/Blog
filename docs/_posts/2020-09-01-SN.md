## Spectral Norm

Three equivalent definitions of the spectral norm of a matrix $$\pmb A$$, $$\sigma(\pmb A)$$:

1. It is the largest singular value of $$\pmb A$$, or equivalently, it is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of the product $$\pmb A^\top\pmb A$$.
2. It is the maximum, over all nonzero vectors $$\pmb{x} \in \mathbb R^n$$, of the quotients $$\frac{\\vert  \pmb A\pmb{x} \\vert }{\\vert  \pmb{x} \\vert }$$ where $$\\vert  \cdot \\vert $$ denotes the Euclidean norm.
3. It is the maximum of the Euclidean norms of vectors $$\pmb A\pmb x$$ where $$\pmb x$$ is on the unit sphere, i.e., has Euclidean norm 1.

**Proof:** From (1), we can get that the spectral norm of $$\pmb A$$ is the square root of the largest solution $$\lambda$$ to $$\pmb A^\top\pmb A\pmb x=\lambda \pmb x$$. Multiplying both sides of the identity by $$\pmb x^\top$$ and take the square, we have

$$
\begin{align}
\sqrt{\pmb x^\top\pmb A^\top\pmb A\pmb x}&=\sqrt{\pmb x^\top\lambda \pmb x}\\\
&=\sqrt{\lambda \pmb x^\top\pmb x}\\\
\Rightarrow\sqrt \lambda&=\sqrt{\pmb x^\top\pmb A^\top\pmb A\pmb x\over \pmb x^\top \pmb x}\\\
&=\frac{\| \pmb A\pmb{x} \|}{\| \pmb{x} \|}\tag{1}\label{eq:1}
\end{align}
$$

Therefore, we have $$\sigma(\pmb A)=\sqrt{\lambda_{\max}}=\max \frac{\\vert  \pmb A\pmb{x} \\vert }{\\vert  \pmb{x} \\vert }$$, where $$\pmb x\in \mathbb R^n, \pmb x\ne \pmb0$$, which gives us $$\eqref{eq:2}$$. In the above analysis, we implicitly assume $$\pmb x$$ is an eigenvector of the linear transformation. This does not need to be the case as $$\pmb A^\top \pmb A$$ is a symmetric metric and we can derive $$\lambda_\max=\max_{\Vert \pmb x\Vert\ne 0}{\pmb x^\top\pmb A\pmb x\over \pmb x^\top\pmb x}$$ following the [Rayleigh-Ritz theorem](#theorem1). $$\eqref{eq:3}$$ simply normalizes $$\pmb x$$, therefore the denominator of Equation $$\eqref{eq:1}$$ becomes $$1$$ and we have $$\sigma(\pmb A)=\max\Vert \pmb A\pmb x\Vert$$, where $$\Vert\pmb x\Vert=1$$.

### Connection with Lipschitz Norm for Linear Functions

Define a linear function $$f(\pmb x)=\pmb A\pmb x$$. We say $$f(\pmb x)$$ is K-Lipschitz continuous if for all $$\pmb x$$ and $$\pmb x'$$,

$$
\Vert f\Vert_{Lip}={\Vert f(\pmb x)-f(\pmb x')\Vert\over \Vert \pmb x-\pmb x'\Vert}\le K\\\
$$

Where $$\Vert\cdot\Vert$$ is the $$\ell_2$$ norm and we say $$\Vert f\Vert_{Lip}$$ is the Lipschitz norm of $$f$$ following [Miyato et al 2018](#1). It is easy to see the connection between the Lipschitz and the spectral norm of $$f$$ once we rewrite $$\Vert f\Vert_{Lip}$$

$$
\Vert f\Vert_{Lip}=\max_{\pmb \delta}{\Vert \pmb A\pmb \delta\Vert\over\Vert\pmb \delta\Vert}=\sigma(\pmb A)\\\
where\quad\pmb \delta=\pmb x-\pmb x'
$$


## Spectral Norm Regularization

[Yoshida et al. 2017](#ref1) propose to regularize networks by restricting the spectral norm of the weight matrices. They shows that if all activation functions are piecewise linear(e.g. ReLU), to achieve a flat local minimum, it is sufficient to bound the spectral norm of the weight matrix at each layer.

Considering a network $$f_\theta$$ parameterized by $$\theta$$, we want it to be robust to small perturbation $$\pmb \delta$$ to the input $$\pmb x$$. Therefore, we define the metric as the $$\ell_2$$-norm of $$f_\theta(\pmb x+\delta)-f_\theta(\pmb x)$$. If we assume all activations are piecewise linear(e.g. ReLU), then $$f_\theta$$ is a piecewise linear function and locally we can take regard $$f_\theta$$ as a linear function. This allows us to represent $$f$$ locally by an affine map $$\pmb x\mapsto W_{\theta,\pmb x}\pmb x+\pmb b_{\theta,\pmb x}$$, for a small perturbation to the input, we have 

$$
{\Vert f_\theta(\pmb x+\pmb \delta)-f_\theta(\pmb x)\Vert_2\over \Vert\pmb \delta\Vert_2}={\Vert W_{\theta,\pmb x}(\pmb x+\pmb \delta)+\pmb b_{\theta,\pmb x})-(W_{\theta,\pmb x}\pmb x+\pmb b_{\theta,\pmb x})\Vert_2\over \Vert\pmb \delta\Vert_2}={\Vert W_{\theta,\pmb x}\pmb \delta\Vert_2\over \Vert\pmb \delta\Vert_2}\le \sigma(W_{\theta,\pmb x})
$$

where $$\sigma(W_{\theta,\pmb \delta})$$ is the spectral norm of $$W_{\theta, \pmb\delta}$$.

Notice that the above analysis is based on a strong assumption that $$f_\theta(\pmb x+\pmb \delta)$$ lies in the linear neighbor of $$f_\theta(\pmb x)$$. We assume it is true in this post. Let's denote the activation at layer $$l$$ as a local diagonal matrix $$D_{\theta,\pmb x}^l$$ and weight in each layer as $$W^l$$. We can rewrite $$W_{\theta,\pmb x}$$ as $$W_{\theta,\pmb x}=\prod_{l=1}^LD_{\theta,\pmb x}^lW^l$$. Notice tha $$\sigma(D_{\theta,\pmb x}^l)\le 1$$ for all $$l\in\{1,\dots,L\}$$. Hence we have

$$
\sigma(W_{\theta,\pmb x})\le \prod_{l=1}^L\sigma(D_{\theta,\pmb x}^l)\sigma(W^l)\le\prod_{l=1}^L\sigma(W^l)
$$

It follows that, to bound the spectral norm of $$W_{\theta,\pmb x}$$, it suffices to bound the spectral norm of $$W^l$$ for each $$l\in \{1,\dots,L\}$$. We do not discuss the regularization method proposed by [Yoshida et al. 2017](#ref1), which manually tackles the gradients of each layer. Instead, we briefly mention several take-aways from the paper next, and discuss another method for regularizing spectral norm in the next section.

### Several take-aways

- [Hochreiter&Jurgen Schmidhuber 1997](#ref2) shows A flat local minimum generalizes better than a sharp one (see Figure 1 for an illustration). 
- [Keskar et al. 2017](#ref3) shows SGD with smaller minibatch size tends to converge to a flatter minimum. 
- [Goodfellow et al. 2015](#ref4) shows that training using adversarial examples improves test accuracy. 
- [Arjovsky et al.](#ref7) and [Wisdom et al](#ref6) shows that by restricting the weight matrices in RNN to be unitary or orthogonal, the problem of diminishing/exploding gradients in RNN can be prevented and better performance can be obtained.

## Spectral Norm Layers

Based on [Yoshida et al. 2017](#ref1), [Miyato et al. 2018](#ref7) develope spectral normalization layers, which explicitly normalizes the spectral norm of the weight matrix in each layer so that it satisfies the Lipschitz constraints $$\sigma(W)=1$$:

$$
W_{SN}(W):=W/\sigma(W)
$$

where $$\sigma(W)$$ is the spectral norm of $$W$$. We can verify its spectral norm by showing

$$
\sigma(W_{SN}(W))=\sigma(W)/\sigma(W)=1
$$

[Miyato et al. 2018](#ref7) further prove that spectral normalization regularizes the gradient of $$W$$, preventing the column space of $$W$$ from concentrating into one particular direction. This precludes the transformation of each layer from becoming sensitive in one direction.

### How to Compute The Spectral Norm?

Assume $$W$$ is of shape $$(N, M)$$​ and we have a randomly initialized vector $$u$$. The power iteration method computes the spectral norm of $$W$$ as follows

$$
\begin{align}
&\mathbf{For}\ i= 1...T:\\\
&\quad v = W^Tu/\Vert W^Tu\Vert_2\\\
&\quad u = Wv/\Vert Wv\Vert_2\\\
&\sigma(W)=u^TWv
\end{align}
$$

where $$u$$ and $$v$$ approximate the first left and right singular vector of $$W$$. In practice, $$T=1$$ is sufficient since we gradually update $$W$$ as well.

### <a name='theorem1'></a>Rayleigh-Ritz theorem

**Rayleigh-Ritz theorem:** Let $$\pmb A \in \mathbb R^{n\times n}$$ be a symmetric matrix. Then its eigenvectors are the critical points of the Rayleigh quotient defined as

$$
R(\pmb x)={\pmb x^\top\pmb A^\top\pmb A\pmb x\over \pmb x^\top \pmb x}
$$

As a consequence, we have

$$
\lambda_{\max}=\max_{\Vert\pmb x\Vert\ne 0}{\pmb x^\top\pmb A^\top\pmb A\pmb x\over \pmb x^\top \pmb x}
$$

and 

$$
\lambda_{\min}=\min{\Vert\pmb x\Vert\ne 0}{\pmb x^\top\pmb A^\top\pmb A\pmb x\over \pmb x^\top \pmb x}
$$

**Proof.** At the critic point $$\bar{\pmb x}$$, we have

$$
{dR(\bar{\pmb x})\over d \bar{\pmb x}}={d({\bar{\pmb x}^\top\pmb A^\top\pmb A\bar{\pmb x}\over \bar{\pmb x}^\top \bar{\pmb x}})\over d\bar{\pmb x}}\pmb 0
$$

 Using the derivative rule, we obtain

$$
\begin{align}
{ {(\bar{\pmb x}^\top\pmb A^\top\pmb A\bar{\pmb x})\over d\bar{\pmb x}}\bar{\pmb x}^\top \bar{\pmb x} 
-\bar{\pmb x}^\top\pmb A^\top\pmb A\bar{\pmb x} {d(\bar{\pmb x}^\top \bar{\pmb x})\over d\bar{\pmb x}}
\over (\bar{\pmb x}^\top \bar{\pmb x})^2}&=\pmb 0\\\
{ {(\bar{\pmb x}^\top\pmb A^\top\pmb A\bar{\pmb x})\over d\bar{\pmb x}} 
-R(\bar{\pmb x}) {d(\bar{\pmb x}^\top \bar{\pmb x})\over d\bar{\pmb x}}
\over \bar{\pmb x}^\top \bar{\pmb x}}&=\pmb 0\\\
2\pmb A\bar{\pmb x}-2R(\bar{\pmb x})\bar{\pmb x}&=0\\\
\pmb A\bar{\pmb x}&=R(\bar{\pmb x})\bar{\pmb x}
\end{align}
$$

The proof complete as the last equation is the eigenvalue equation.
