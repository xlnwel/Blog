## Introduction

Many combinations of RNN architectures and attention mechanisms, such as [RMC]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-04-21-RMC %}) and [DNC]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-11-01-DNC %}), have been covered in this blog. In this post, we first briefly review the content-based input attention proposed by Bahdanau et al.. Then we shift our attention to pointer network(PtrNet) proposed by Vinyals&Fortunato.

## Content-Based Input Attention

Traditional seq2seq models produce the entire output sequence using the fixed dimensional state of the recognition RNN at the end of the input sequence. This constrains the amount of information that computation can flow through to the generative model. Bahdanau et al. in ICLR 2015 proposed to add an additional attention model to ameliorates this problem so that the model can learn to attend to different parts of the input sequence for different outputs. In particular, they use a bidirectional LSTM as the recognition network that encodes all sequential information. The generative network is another RNN that predicts the output $$s_t$$ for the current time-step based on the previous hidden state $$s_{t-1}$$ and the current context vector $$c_t$$ from the encoder. Mathematically, we have

$$
\begin{align}
p(s_t|s_1,\dots,s_{t-1},\mathbf x)&=f(s_{t-1}, c_t)
\end{align}
$$

where $$f$$ denotes an RNN operation, and the context vector $$c_t$$ depends on a sequence of annotations $$h_1, \dots, h_T$$ to which an encoder maps the input sequence. Each annotation $$h_t$$ contains information about the whole input sequence with a strong focus on the parts surrounding the $$t$$-th element of the input sequence. More specifically, an annotation $$h_t$$ is the concatenation of hidden states computed by the forward and backward RNNs.

The context vector $$c_t$$ is computed as a weighted sum of these annotations

$$
\begin{align}c_t&=\sum_{k=1}^Ta_{tk}h_k\\\where\quad a_{tk}&=\mathrm {softmax}(f_{att}(s_{t-1}, h_k))\end{align}
$$

We can see that when $$f_{att}$$ is a dot-product function, $$c_t$$ is computed through a attention module.

The attention function $$f_{att}$$ calculates an unnormalized alignment score that reflects the importance of the annotation $$h_k$$ with respect to the previous hidden state $$s_{t-1}$$ in deciding the next state $$s_t$$ and generating $$y_t$$. It's typically defined as on of the following

$$
f_{att}(s_{t-1}, h_k)=\begin{cases}
s_{t-1}^{\top}h_k&\text{dot}\\\
s_{t-1}^{\top}Wh_k&\text{general}\\\
v^{\top}\tanh(W_ss_{t-1}+W_hh_k)&\text{concat}
\end{cases}
$$

where $$v^\top$$ is a column of the weights in a dense layer.

Intuitively, this implements a mechanism of attention in the decoder. The decoder then decides parts of the source sentence to pay attention to.

## Pointer Network

While the above model serves the needs of translating an input sequence into an output sequence, such as machine translation, the pointer network(PtrNet) is targeted at *selecting a sequence of members of the input sequence* as the output, e.g., finding planar convex hulls and the planar Travelling Salesman Problem. As a result, PtrNet can be concisely expressed as follow

$$
\begin{align}
u_{t,k}&=v^{\top}\tanh(W_ss_{t-1}+W_hh_k)\\\
p(s_t|s_1,\dots,s_{t-1},\mathbf x)&=\text{softmax}(u_{t,k})
\end{align}
$$

Where $$s$$ denotes a pointer, $$\mathbf x$$ the input, and $$h$$ the input embedding , Notice that the decoder depends only on the previous prediction $$s_{t+1}$$ and hidden state $$h_h$$ and does not contain the context vector $$c$$ since now the output is a pointer to the input position, which per se does not carry any content information. 

## Inference

Another worth mentioning part of these seq2seq algorithms is the beam search method used at inference time. 

Notice that selecting the most probable value at each step during inference is likely to get a suboptimal solution because the output probabilities are dependent. However, maximizing the sequential probability $$p(s_{1:T_{out}}\vert h_{1:T_{in}})$$ is computationally intractable because of the combinatorial number of possible output sequences. As a result, we usually use a beam search procedure to find the best possible sequence given a beam size $$n$$. This process repeats the following steps for each time step

1. At each time step $$t$$, we maintain $$n$$ subsequences $$s_{1:t-1}$$ from the previous step, each with its probability $$p(s_{1:t-1}\vert h_{1:T_{in}})$$.
2. Then for each $$s_{1:t-1}$$, we compute all $$p(s_t\vert h_{1:T_{in}}, s_{1:t-1})$$ and multiply them by $$p(s_{1:t-1}\vert h_{1:T_{in}})$$ to get $$p(s_{1:t}\vert h_{1:T_{in}})$$
3. We then select new $$n$$ subsequences $$s_{1:t}$$ with the maximal probabilities $$p(s_{1:t}\vert h_{1:T_{in}})$$ for the next stage.
