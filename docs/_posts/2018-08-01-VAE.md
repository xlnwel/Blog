## Introduction

A vanilla autoencoder encodes an input to a smaller dimensional representation, which stores latent information about the input data distribution. But the encoded vector (latent variable) in a vanilla autoencoder can only be mapped to the corresponding input. It cannot be used to generate similar images with some variability.

A variational autoencoder, on the other hand, is designed for such variability. It has a similar architecture as a vanilla autoencoder, except that it provides variability in two ways:

1. The latent variable $$ z $$ is sampled from a distribution specified by the encoder network (recall in a vanilla autoencoder, $$ z $$ is directly output by the encoder)
2. The decoder network also outputs a distribution $$ p_\theta(x^{(i)}\vert z) $$ from which $$ x $$ is sampled (in a vanilla autoencoder, the decoder network deterministically outputs something similar to the input $$ x^{(i)} $$)

## Workflow

The figure below is a general architecture for a variational autoencoder

<a name='net'></a>![variational autoencoder]({{ '/images/generative network/variational autoencoder.png' | absolute_url }})

The encoder network (aka. recognition/inference network) takes $$ x^{(i)} $$ as input and outputs the mean and variance of a Gaussian distribution $$ q_\phi(z\vert x) $$ from which we sample the latent variable $$ z $$. The decoder network (aka. generation network), on the other hand, takes $$ z $$ as input and output the mean and variance of a Gaussian distribution for $$ p_\theta(x^{(i)}\vert z) $$.

## <a name='loss'></a> Loss

In order to train a network, we want to maximize the likelihood of the training data. That is,

$$
p_\theta(x^{(i)})=\int p_\theta(x^{(i)}|z)p_\theta(z)dz
$$

where $$ p_\theta(z) $$ is simply the standard norm distribution $$ \mathcal N(0,1) $$. By maximizing $$ p_\theta(x^{(i)}) $$, we maximize the expected likelihood of generating $$ x^{(i)} $$ given latent variable $$ z $$ sampled from $$ p_\theta(z) $$, the standard normal distribution. This equation, however, is intractable since the integral suggests to compute $$ p_\theta(x^{(i)}\vert z)p_\theta(z) $$ for every $$ z $$.

Consider it in a Bayesian model, where we have 

$$
p_\theta(x^{(i)})={p_\theta(x^{(i)}|z)p_\theta(z)\over p_\theta(z|x^{(i)})}
$$

In the above equation, although $$ p_\theta(z\vert x^{(i)}) $$ per se is also intractable, we can use an encoder network $$ q_\phi(z\vert x^{(i)}) $$ to approximate it. Some literature replaces $$ p_\theta(x^{(i)}) $$ with $$ q_\phi(x^{(i)}) $$ so as to be consistent with $$ q_\phi(z\vert x^{(i)}) $$. Since they both express the distribution of the data $$ x^{(i)} $$, just in different notations, we don't bother to change the notation here.

Let's take the expectation of the log of both sides

$$
\begin{align}
\log p_\theta(x^{(i)})&=E_{z\sim q_{\phi}(z|x^{(i)})}\left[\log {p_\theta(x^{(i)}|z)p_\theta(z)\over p_\theta(z|x^{(i)})}\right]\\\
&=E_z\left[\log {p_\theta(x^{(i)}|z)p_\theta(z)\over p_\theta(z|x^{(i)})}{q_\phi(z|x^{(i)})\over q_\phi(z|x^{(i)})}\right]\\\
&=E_z\left[\log {q_\phi(z|x^{(i)})\over p_\theta(z|x^{(i)})}-\log {q_\phi(z|x^{(i)})\over p_\theta(z)} + \log p_\theta(x^{(i)}|z) \right]\\\
&=D_{KL}\left(q_\phi(z|x^{(i)})\Vert p_\theta(z|x^{(i)})\right)-D_{KL}\left(q_\phi(z|x^{(i)})\Vert p_\theta(z)\right)+E_z\left[ \log p_\theta(x^{(i)}|z)\right]
\end{align}
$$

Note that $$ E_{z\sim q_\phi(z\vert x^{(i)})}\left[\log p_\theta(x^{(i)})\right]=\log p_\theta(x^{(i)}) $$ since $$ p_\theta(x^{(i)}) $$ doesn't depend on $$ z $$. We can see from the last step that the objective function consists of two KL divergences and a log likelihood. As we discussed before, the only thing intractable here is $$ p_\theta(z\vert x^{(i)}) $$ in the first KL divergence. Since KL divergence is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to $$ 0 $$, we could derive the *Evidence Lower BOund(ELBO)* on the log data likelihood

$$
\begin{align}
ELBO(x^{(i)};\phi,\theta) &= -D_{KL}\left(q_\phi(z|x^{(i)})\Vert p_\theta(z)\right)+E_z\left[ \log p_\theta(x^{(i)}|z)\right]
\end{align}
$$

It's called evidence lower bound since $$ p_\theta(x^{(i)}) $$ is generally called the evidence.

Because ELBO is the lower bound of $$ \log p_\theta(x^{(i)}) $$, the objective we want to maximize, it is quite intuitive to use the negative of the ELBO as a loss function.

$$
\begin{align}
\mathcal L(x^{(i)};\phi,\theta) &= -ELBO(x^{(i)};\phi,\theta)\\\
&= D_{KL}\left(q_\phi(z|x^{(i)})\Vert p_\theta(z)\right) - E_z\left[ \log p_\theta(x^{(i)}|z)\right]
\end{align}
$$

The first term, the KL divergence, is a regularizer for $$ \phi $$, which encourages the approximate $$ q_\phi(z\vert x^{(i)}) $$ to be close to the prior $$ p_\theta(z) $$. This makes sense, because, as we said at the beginning, we want to maximize the likelihood of generating $$ x^{(i)} $$ given latent variable $$ z $$ sampled from $$ p_\theta(z) $$. In practice, if we represent $$ q_\phi(z\vert x^{(i)}) $$ and $$ p_\theta (z) $$ as Gaussians $$ \mathcal N(\mu, \sigma^2) $$ and $$ \mathcal N(\mathbf 0, \mathbf I) $$ respectively, this term can be integrated analytically:

$$
D_{KL}\left(q_\phi(z|x^{(i)})\Vert p_\theta(z)\right) = -{1\over 2}\sum_{j=1}^J\left(1+2\log\sigma_j-\mu_j^2-\sigma_j^2\right)
$$

where $$ J $$ is the dimensionality of $$ z $$.

The second term, the negative log data likelihood, is the reconstruction loss, which maximizes the likelihood that the generation network outputs $$ x_i $$ given $$ z $$ sampled from the approximate $$ q_\phi(z\vert x^{(i)}) $$. The probability is commonly defined as a multivariate Gaussian, i.e.

$$
  p_\theta(x^{(i)}|z) = \mathcal N(x^{(i)};\mu, \sigma^2) 
$$

where $$ \mu $$ and $$ \sigma $$ are computed by decoder network as the topmost [figure](#net) illustrates

In general, this loss term cannot be backpropagated to the encoder parameter $$ \phi $$ since $$ z $$ is sampled from $$ q_\phi(z\vert x^{(i)}) $$. To solve this problem, we need to reparameterize the random variable $$ z $$ using a differentiable transformation $$ g_\phi(\epsilon, x) $$ and an auxiliary noise variable $$ \epsilon $$:

$$
z=g_\phi(\epsilon, x), \epsilon \sim p(\epsilon)
$$

In general, we choose $$ \epsilon $$ from the standard normal distribution, and we have

$$
z=\mu+\sigma \cdot \epsilon, \epsilon \sim \mathcal N(\mathbf 0, \mathbf I)
$$
