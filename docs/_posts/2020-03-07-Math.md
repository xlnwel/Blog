### Lipschitz Continuity

A function is **Lipschitz continuous** if there is a positive constant $$K$$ such that, for all $$x$$ and $$y$$

$$
|f(x)-f(y)| < K|x-y|
$$

This says the function $$f$$ cannot grow too fast. Particularly, if the function is continuous, this says that the function has bounded derivative.

Furthermore, if the Lipschitz constant $$K<1$$, the function $$f$$ is a [contraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraction_mapping).

### Change of Variables

#### Single/Multiple Variables

Let $$X\in R^n$$ be a continuous multi-variate random variable, and let $$Y=f(X)$$ be injective(one-to-one) and continuously differentiable. Then we have

$$
dy=|\det(J_f(X))|dx
$$

where $$J_f(X)$$ is the Jacobian matrix, whose $$(i,j)$$th entry is $$J_{i,j}={\part y_i\over\part x_j}$$. This is consistent with the single variable case where we have

$$
dy=f'(x)dx
$$


#### Application in Probability

Suppose we know the PDF of $$X$$ as $$P(X)$$, and let $$Y=f(X)$$ be injective and continuously differentiable. Then we have

$$
p_y(y)=p_x(x)\left|dx\over dy\right|
$$

We prove this as follows: As $$f(X)$$ is injective, geometrically, we have

$$
p_y(y)dy=p_x(x)dx\ge0\\\
p_y(y)=p_x(x){dx\over dy}
$$

Because $$p_y(y),p_x(x)\ge0$$, we need to ensure $${d_x\over dy}\ge0$$. As a result, we have

$$
\begin{align}
p_y(y)&=p_x(x)\left|dx\over dy\right|\\\
&=p_x(x)\left|dy\over dx\right|^{-1}
\end{align}
$$

Similarly, for multiple variables, we have

$$
p_{\pmb y}(\pmb y)=p_{\pmb x}(\pmb x)\left|\det\left({d\pmb y\over d\pmb x}\right)\right|^{-1}
$$

## Duality Theorem

For a primal linear program defined by

$$
\begin{align}
&\text{maximize}&\pmb c^\top \pmb x\\\
&s.t. &\pmb A\pmb x\le \pmb b\\\
&&\pmb x\ge\pmb 0
\end{align}
$$

the dual takes the form

$$
\begin{align}
&\text{minimize}&\pmb b^\top \pmb y\\\
&s.t. &\pmb A^\top \pmb y\ge \pmb c\\\
&&\pmb y\ge\pmb 0
\end{align}
$$

This is called the symmetric dual problem. There are two other dual problems listed [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_linear_program#Vector_formulations). For simplicity, we only discuss the symmetric dual problem.

### Weak Duality

**Weak Duality:** For any feasible solution $$x$$ and $$y$$ to primal and dual linear programs, $$\pmb c^\top \pmb x\le \pmb b^\top \pmb y$$.

**Proof:** Multiplying both sides of $$\pmb A\pmb x\le \pmb b$$ by $$\pmb y^\top$$, we have $$\pmb y^\top \pmb A\pmb x\le \pmb y^\top \pmb b$$. Since $$\pmb A^\top \pmb y\ge \pmb c$$, we have $$\pmb c^\top \pmb x\le \pmb y^\top \pmb A\pmb x\le \pmb y^\top \pmb b$$.

There are two immediate implication of weak duality:

1. If both $$\pmb x$$ and $$\pmb y$$ are feasible solutions to the primal and dual and $$\pmb c^\top \pmb x=\pmb b^\top \pmb y$$, then $$\pmb x$$ and $$\pmb y$$ must be optimal solutions
2. If the optimal profit in the primal is $$\infty$$, then the dual must be infeasible. If the optimal cost in the dual is $$-\infty$$, then the primal must be infeasible

The weak duality always holds regardless whether the primal is convex or not.

### Strong Duality

**Strong Duality:** The duality has an optimal solution if and only if the primal does. If $$\pmb x^*$$ and $$\pmb y^*$$ are optimal solutions to the primal and dual, then $$\pmb c^\top \pmb x^*=\pmb b^\top \pmb y^*$$.

The strong duality only holds when the primal is convex.

To prove strong duality, we first introduce Farkas' Lemma and KKT conditions.

#### Farkas' Lemma

**Farkas' Lemma:** Let $$\pmb A\in\mathbb R^{m⨉ n}$$ and $$\pmb b\in\mathbb R^m$$. Then exactly one of the following two assertions is true:

1. There exists an $$\pmb x\in\mathbb R^n$$ such that $$\pmb A\pmb x=\pmb b$$ and $$\pmb x\ge 0$$
2. There exists a $$\pmb y\in\mathbb R^m$$ such that $$\pmb A^\top\pmb y\ge 0$$ and $$\pmb b^\top\pmb y<0$$

**Proof:** If both $$\eqref{eq:1}$$ and $$\eqref{eq:2}$$ hold, then $$0>\pmb b^\top \pmb y=\pmb y^\top \pmb A\pmb x\ge 0$$, which is a contradiction.

We resorts the following geometric interpretation to show that either $$\eqref{eq:1}$$ or $$\eqref{eq:2}$$ is true.

**Geometric interpretation:** Consider the closed convex cone spanned by the columns of $$\pmb A$$; that is

$$
C(\pmb A)=\{\pmb A\pmb x|\pmb x\ge 0\}
$$

Farkas' lemma equally says that either $$\pmb b$$ in $$C(\pmb A)$$ or there exists a hyperplane that separates $$\pmb b$$ and $$C(\pmb A)$$. If $$\pmb b$$ is not in $$C(\pmb A)$$, then we can compute $$\pmb y$$ as the vector orthogonal to the hyperplane. The following figure visualizes these two cases

#### KKT conditions

**KKT conditions:** Suppose that $$f,g^1,g^2,g^M$$ are differentiable functions from $$\mathbb R^N$$ to $$\mathbb R$$. Let $$\pmb x^*$$ be the point that maximizes $$f$$ subject to $$g^i(\pmb x)\le 0$$ for each $$i$$, and assume the first $$k$$ constraints are active and $$\pmb x^*$$ is regular. Then there exists $$\pmb y\ge 0$$ such that $$\nabla f(\pmb x)=y_1\nabla g^1(\pmb x)+...+y_k\nabla g^k(\pmb x)$$

**Proof:** Let $$c=\nabla f(\pmb x^*)$$. The directional derivative of $$f$$ in the direction of vector $$\pmb z$$ is $$\pmb z^\top\pmb c$$. Because $$\pmb x^*$$ is the maximum point, every feasible direction $$\pmb z$$ must have $$\pmb z^\top\pmb c < 0$$. Let $$\pmb A\in\mathbb R^{k\times N}$$ be the matrix whose $$i$$th row is $$(\nabla g^i(\pmb x))^\top$$. Then a direction $$\pmb z$$ is feasible if $$\pmb A\pmb z\le 0$$. As $$\pmb z^\top\pmb c<0$$ and $$\pmb A\pmb z\le 0$$ violate Farkas' case $$\eqref{eq:2}$$ , there is a $$\pmb y\ge \pmb 0$$ such that $$\pmb A\pmb y=\pmb c$$.

#### Proof of Strong Duality

Let

$$
\pmb{\hat A}=\begin{bmatrix}\pmb A\\\-\pmb I_n\\\-\pmb c^\top\end{bmatrix},\pmb{\hat b}=\begin{bmatrix}\pmb b\\\\pmb 0\\\-(\tau+\epsilon)\end{bmatrix}
$$

where $$\tau=\pmb c^\top\pmb x^*$$ is the optimal value of the primal, $$\epsilon\ge 0$$ is an arbitrary value. Because $$\tau$$ is the optimal value, there is no feasible $$\pmb x$$ such that $$\pmb c^\top\pmb x=\tau+\epsilon$$. Therefore, there is no $$\pmb x\in\mathbb R^n$$ such that

$$
\begin{bmatrix}\pmb A\\\-\pmb I_n\\\-\pmb c^\top\end{bmatrix}\pmb x\le \begin{bmatrix}\pmb b\\\\pmb 0\\\-(\tau+\epsilon)\end{bmatrix}
$$

By the variant of Farkas' Lemma, we have $$\pmb{\hat y}=\begin{bmatrix}\pmb y\\\ \pmb z\\\ \alpha\end{bmatrix}\ge0$$, such that

$$
\begin{bmatrix}\pmb y^\top&\pmb z^\top&\alpha\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}\pmb A\\\-\pmb I_n\\\-\pmb c^\top\end{bmatrix}=0,\quad \begin{bmatrix}\pmb y^\top&\pmb z^\top&\alpha\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}\pmb b\\\\pmb 0\\\-(\tau+\epsilon)\end{bmatrix}=-1\\\
$$

Thus, we have

$$
\pmb y^\top\pmb A=\pmb z^\top+\alpha\pmb c^\top,\quad \pmb y^\top\pmb b=-1+\alpha(\tau+\epsilon)<\alpha(\tau+\epsilon)
$$

If $$\alpha=0$$, then the dual is unbounded or infeasible -- for any feasible solution $$\pmb y_*$$, we have $$(\pmb y_*^\top+\lambda \pmb y^\top)\pmb A\ge\pmb c^\top+\lambda\pmb z^\top$$ and $$(\pmb y_*^\top+\lambda\pmb y^\top)\pmb b=\pmb y_*^\top\pmb b-\lambda$$. Taking $$\lambda$$ large, we see that the dual problem is unbounded. Therefore, $$\alpha>1$$ and by scaling $$\pmb {\hat y}$$, we may assume that $$\alpha=1$$. So $$\pmb y^\top \pmb A\ge c^\top$$ and $$\pmb y^\top\pmb b\le \tau+\epsilon$$. By the Weak Dual Theorem, we have $$\tau= \pmb c^\top \pmb x\le\pmb y^\top\pmb b\le\tau+\epsilon$$. Since $$\epsilon$$ is arbitrary, we have $$\pmb c^\top \pmb x\le\pmb y^\top\pmb b$$.
